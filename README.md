Actually the origin from this project from my object oriented programming language 2 ( C#) courses , I had to submit a project end of the course , and the dream came true. While searching on internet I found this snippet on **[Github!](https://github.com/samjudson/flickrnet-samples)**

> **Project dependencies :**

>-  Project built on .Net 4.0 Client Profile on IDE Visual Studio 2012
> - Currently Desktoper is only connected to [flickr.com](https://www.flickr.com/)
> - Once user search any interest/tag from desktoper , Initially desktoper request to flickr.com api and fetch 50 relevance pictures based on users screen resulation width.
> - If ***Blur*** checked , then the collected image url is posted to [imageresizer.io](http://imageresizer.io) and rest of blurring algorithm managed by them.  **:D**  
> - Please **don't** blame me I am pirate of flickr, you'll see a '*courtesy*' checkbox bottom of the UI , if you check that then owner name will be placed on left most corner.
> - The technique behind setting up the wallpaper on windows machine is to editing *registry*  
>  `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop` a `wallaper` key is the reason for this.  See details [implementation](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsapps/CSSetDesktopWallpaper-2107409c)
